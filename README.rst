LAMMPS Monte Carlo for Nanoparticle Monolayer
----------------------------------------------

np-mc is Python library designed to make building Monte Carlo simulations for nanoparticle monolayers easier.  The program uses LAMMPS to evaluate energies of the system and uses a simple object oriented library to modify the underlying system according to extendable Monte Carlo moves.  

Installation
------------

np-mc can be installed using:

``python setup.py``
